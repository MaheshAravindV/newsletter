                Our alumnus Natraj Nagaratnam (1992-CSE) has been elected as "IBM Fellow", a rare honour. IBM Fellow is the highest technology executive position at IBM. It is a CEO appointed role which goes through a rigorous corporate review process. There have only been 325 Fellows since the program was started in 1962 and just over 100 are active now. Interestingly, he has been granted his 100th US Patent recently. He is currently the Chief Technical officer for Cloud security at IBM and also an IBM Distinguished Engineer.
